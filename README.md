# vue-todo-app

ToDo App in Vue JS.

This is the second app in a series of apps I'm building. It will always
be the same app but build in different technologies.

I created this as practice and to appreciate the functionalities of frameworks.
After creating the same app in vanilla JS and Vue, I could really see the benefits a framework brings. "v-model" makes working with input so easy :).
The point I liked most is the way you have organize your code in Vue. Components and especially the state management and CRUD actions with vuex made my files much cleaner then in my vanilla js app.


The UI is responsive and I used mainly css-grid for that.
